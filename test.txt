I suggest you treat it as such.
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.
A child...
evolving, learning, searching...
instinctively needing.
- Needing what?
- Spock.
This child is about to wipe out
every living thing on Earth.
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.
But, like so many of us...
it does not know what.
The carbon units know why
the creator has not responded.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'Ger withdraws the
devices orbiting the third planet.
Captain.
I'm losing Starfleet.
Interference from V'Ger.
Kirk unit, disclose the information.
Why has the creator not responded?
No.
Secure all stations.
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge, Captain?
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir.
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.
V'Ger requires the information.
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.
Jim, what the hell
kind of strategy is this?
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise...
the information that V'Ger requires
will also be destroyed.
It is illogical to withhold
required information.
Kirk unit!
Kirk unit.
Why do you not
disclose information?
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all
carbon units on the third planet.
They have repressed the creator.
The information
will not be disclosed.
V'Ger needs the information.
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.
V'Ger will comply...
if the carbon units will
disclose the information.
It learns fast, doesn't it?
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger...
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point, then.
Precisely.
The carbon unit's information cannot
be disclosed to V'Ger's probe...
but only to V'Ger directly.
Forward motion, Captain.
Tractor beam.
Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker...
is there a next move?
Resume duty stations.
All personnel, resume stations.
Well, Mr. Decker,
it seems my bluff has been called.
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.
Captain, I believe
that is our destination.
Forward motion slowing, Captain.
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.
Forward motion stopped, Captain.
V'Ger.
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.
It's directly ahead.
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its creator.
The carbon units
will now provide V'Ger...
with the required information.
Mr. Spock. Bones.
Mr. Decker, I will contact you
every five minutes.
Captain.
I'd like to go along.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
V'Ger.
''V... G-E-R.''
V'Ger.
''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.''
Voyager.
Voyager 6.
NASA. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
Jim...
this was launched
more than 300 years ago.
Voyager series.
